            <P class="p1">Junk food in its various forms is extremely popular, and an integral part of modern popular
                culture. In
                the
                US, annual fast food sales are in the area of $160 billion,[25] compared to supermarket sales of $620
                billion[26] (a figure which also includes junk food in the form of convenience foods, snack foods, and
                candy). In 1976, "Junk Food Junkie", a US top 10 pop song, described a junk food addict who pretends to
                follow a healthy diet by day, while at night gorges on Hostess Twinkies and Fritos corn chips,
                McDonald's
                and KFC.</P>

            <p id="health1">hen junk food is consumed very often, the excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed
                sugar found in
                junk food contributes to an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic
                health conditions</p>
